This assignment was quite difficult. 

I created the basic template of my webpage utilizing what we have learned so far about html. 

I then utilized bootstrap to input a navbar across the entire site, a card on the portfolio page, and a contact form on the contact webpage. 

I had difficulty getting my h1 element to be responsive and had to get outside help to get this to work. I have looked over the code that was given to me and
while it works I am unsure as to how it works. This is difficult for me as I want to understand what is going on. Many thanks to my brother Benjamin who helped me with this portion of the code. (see lines 15-20). 

I followed the basic layout of the examples given for color and decoration of the webpage. It wasn't until much later that I realized we could style this however we wanted. This may be something I change in the future but for now I was more focused on getting the overall website to be responsive.
